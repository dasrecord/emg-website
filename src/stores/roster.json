This diverse upbringing had a profound impact on his musical formation.<br><br>His professional music career kicked off in Los Angeles, where he worked on music for TV, film, commercials, and video games. From creating tracks for 20th Century Fox and Disney to scoring for Mercedes, BMW, and Amazon commercials, Nors Kode made his mark. He also played in various live bands, exploring styles from Jazz to Alternative Rock.<br><br>During the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020, he joined Giorgia Angiuli's project \"United.\" This venture not only got him featured in the project but also led to a fruitful collaboration with the Italian Prog House star.

Together, his releases have racked up over 1.9M streams on Spotify.<br> <br><br>Nors Kode's unique style comes from his love of crafting soundscapes, a skill honed during his days as an LA-based film music composer, and his passion for electronic beats brimming with emotional depth. It's this distinctive blend that sets his music apart.<br><br>Today, Nors Kode is based in the vibrant city of Barcelona, Spain. His music journey continues as he combines his film music experience with his love for emotionally charged electronic beats, creating an engaging and compelling sound that's uniquely his own.
