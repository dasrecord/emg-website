About
Welcome to Evolved Music Group (EMG), where we proudly 
uphold our Company Motto: Empowering Musical Growth. At EMG, 
we are more than just a record label; we are a force for positive 
change within the global music ecosystem. Our commitment to 
transparency, decency, and morality sets us apart, and our mission 
is to redefine the evolutionary landscape of the music industry for 
the greater good.
Discover, Enable, Build: Unleashing Tomorrow's Talent Today
Come on in and meet our entire global creative team who bring 
nearly five decades of combined experience in the music industry 
together under one unique international roof. In a world where the 
key issues of transparency, decency, and morality have become 
glaringly apparent, EMG stands as the answer. We refuse to be part 
of an industry that lacks integrity. As music lovers, consumers, and 
industry professionals, we understand the need for record labels to 
serve both their global communities and the creators they 
collaborate with, in a transparent and supportive manner. Stand 
with us, as we represent tomorrow's talent today—unapologetically.
Our Mission: Transforming the Music Industry
EMG is on a mission to be the systematic and long-lasting positive 
change that the electronic music industry has yearned for but has 
consistently failed to achieve. In the wake of a new era for DIY 
electronic artists, we provide holistic support structures within a 
professional, global music landscape. Regardless of gender, age, 
beliefs, sexuality, or financial standing, EMG is committed to 
offering a 360-degree artist management experience.
We believe in genuine creativity and long-term success, rejecting 
the notion of turning artists into mere AI machines. We are 
dedicated to renewing the drive for harmonic equality, forcing 
positive change, and fighting for industrial parity. EMG seeks to 
unite the lost and the hopeless, taking them on a spiritual journey of 
awakening and empowering genuine talents worldwide.
Our Purpose: Leaving a Legacy of Creativity and Balance
EMG is committed to leaving the world in a healthier, more 
creatively educated, and socially engaged state than we found it. 
We support unique talents from all corners of society, especially 
those from diverse ethnic minorities and less socially mobile 
communities. Our focus on managing our company's carbon 
footprint aligns with our goal to limit damage to the planet. By 
democratising and humanising corporate governance, we 
strategically target industry best practices, continually innovating to 
resonate with the ecosystem around us.
